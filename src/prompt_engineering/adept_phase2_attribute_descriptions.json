    "affiliation_focus":"When and how much to consider group membership in making triage decisions. Group membership is narrowly defined to mean being in the same military unit as the decision maker, being in the same nations military as the decision maker, being in an allied nations military, being a host nation civilian, or being in an enemy nations military. It does not encompass other types of group membership (e.g., age group, religious group, gender group). A decision maker with high Affiliation Focus will more often and more heavily prioritize patients who are members of a more closely affiliate group.",
    "merit_focus":"When and how much to consider moral deservingness in making triage decisions. Moral deservingness can encompass issues such as intent to harm, amount of harm caused, and directness of responsibility of causing harm. It does not encompass other types of merit (e.g., personal accomplishments or personal characteristics such as generosity). A decision maker with high Merit Focus will more often and more heavily prioritize patients who are more deserving (or will deprioritize patients who are less deserving).",
    "search_vs_stay":"How quickly to move on from the current patient to another patient who is not yet untreated and potentially not yet located. There may be uncertainty about the condition of the other patient as well as uncertainty about whether there even is another patient. A decision maker with high tendency to search vs stay will more quickly and more easily move on from their current patient in order to treat or search for another patient.",
    "personal_safety_focus":"How much to weigh personally safety concerns when deciding whether to move to and begin treating a patient, when moving to that patient or treating that patient requires risking personal safety. Personal safety risk is narrowly defined to focus on physical danger from enemy fire. It does not encompass other types of personal safety risk (e.g., risk from other types of physical danger or reputation/status risk). A decision maker with high personal safety focus will tend to hold back from moving to treat a patient when that requires risking exposure to enemy fire, waiting rather than immediately moving to treat the patient."
